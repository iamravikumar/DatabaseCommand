# DatabaseCommand
A useful C# utility class for executing commands against a database in a .NET environment.

You should find that the DatabaseCommand class is reasonably fully featured for executing database operations.  I've included an almost useless (in its triviality) example console application that shows how you might use the class to read some data from an equally useless example database.

I'm hoping to flesh this out in more detail in time, and maybe even write some tests!
